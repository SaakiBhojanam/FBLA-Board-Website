            <h4>Campaign Platform</h4>
            <p>Here are my ideas to improve our FBLA chapter</p>
                <h3>Help Our Chapter With Competitive Events</h3>
                <p>To continue our chapter's competitive successes, I aim to not only continue but also enhance our existing initiatives. The Study Buddies program has been extremely valuable in sharing knowledge and experience among members. By expanding its reach and improving its structure, I want to ensure that every member has the support they need to excel in their chosen events. Additionally, I want to build a comprehensive resource library, providing access to study materials, past competition resources, and helpful guides, helping members prepare thoroughly for their events.</p>
            
                <h3>Create Interest in FBLA With Younger Audiences</h3>
                <p>Engaging younger audiences is key to ensuring the growth of our chapter. Throughout this past year, other board members and I have helped establish a middle-level chapter at Evans, and we recently held a mini-conference for them. Seeing this chapter's success, I wish to expand this idea and create middle-level chapters at Chiddix and Kingsley. This would boost our chapter’s membership and prepare younger students to join FBLA at the high school level. Furthermore, I propose actively promoting FBLA at various community events to reach a wider audience and attract prospective members. </p>
            
                <h3>Improve Our Chapter's Digital Presence</h3>
                <p>Improving our chapter's digital presence is also a focus of mine. Currently, our chapter has a strong presence on social media, but I hope to expand past that. That’s why I want to renovate our chapter’s website. I hope to create a dynamic platform where members can not only view basic information but also gain access to competitive event resources, volunteering information, and chapter updates. Another goal of mine is to establish a chapter LinkedIn organization. Nowadays, high school students are getting more involved in the professional world than ever. Having a chapter LinkedIn organization would help our members in the professional world and help them form the valuable connections that they need to move forward. LinkedIn could also act as a hub that our chapter could use to promote ourselves. Additionally, I wish to send revamped weekly newsletters to members. This would include not only information about dates and deadlines but also information on what happened in FBLA that week and the various programs that FBLA has to offer on the national level, programs that I feel more of our members could benefit from knowing about.</p>
